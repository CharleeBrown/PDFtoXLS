PDFtoXLS is a project i quickly developed for in-house use at my company.
We have a need for converting PDFs to XLS format, and I couldn't find a suitable boxed product.

It currently works as follows: 

-	Select the PDFs that you need to convert.
-	They will be listed in the ListView to the right of the screen.
- Press PDFtoXLS to begin the conversion.
- You will be prompted to select a folder to save the converted files.
- A prmopt will appear to name each file. By default it will have the original filename minus the extention
- After naming each file, they will appear in the chosen save location.
